		<h2>Sultans of Swing</h2>
		<h3>By Dire Straits</h3>

		<p>You get a shiver in the dark<br>
		It's a raining in the park but meantime-<br>
		South of the river you stop and you hold everything<br>
		A band is blowing Dixie, double four time<br>
		You feel alright when you hear the music ring<br>
		<hr>
		Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces<br>
		Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down<br>
		Competition in other places<br>
		Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound<br>
		Way on down south<br>
		Way on down south<br>
		London town<br>
		<hr>
		You check out guitar George, he knows-all the chords<br>
		Mind, it's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make it cry or sing<br>
		They said an old guitar is all, he can afford<br>
		When he gets up under the lights to play his thing<br>
		<hr>
		And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene<br>
		He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright<br>
		He can play the Honky Tonk like anything<br>
		Savin' it up, for Friday night<br>
		With the Sultans<br>
		We're the Sultans of Swing<br>
