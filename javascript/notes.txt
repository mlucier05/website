 Chapter 1/2
- Strings can be written using "",'', or ``
- Use ${} inside of strings for template literals (math)
- When comparing strings, for the most part it is alphabetic but uppercase is less than lowercase
- Ternary operators use "?" depending on result of the conditional operator it decides the output
- Short circuiting binary operators exists like in java

Chapter 3
- Functions kind of look like variables, and they act as methods would in java
- The scopes of bindings, constants, and variables, are quite easy to understand
- Functions that are declared automatically get moved to the "top" of the flow of control
- Arrow Functions are cool for when you need to write small functions because they don't take up a lot of space
- If the Call Stack gets too large, js will produce an error
- js will accept any number of arguments into a function regardless if they are the correct type or amount
- Using an "=" after an argument means that the argument will equal that if an input isn't given, like a fallback or default
